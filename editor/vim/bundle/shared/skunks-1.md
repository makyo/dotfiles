%title Dry Grass — 2412

The letter arrives via sensorium, a mere ping notifying her of some piece of data made available via a temporary partition in some grand System-spanning exocortex. It is addressed to her, personally, a message from Castor. Convergence, particularly, she learns when she pulls it up to read behind closed eyelids.

> Dry Grass,
> 
> It has been a long time coming since you first reached out to me to notify me of the loss of my root instance in the Century Attack. I know I have made the same mistake as had you fork to begin with in hyperfixating on the technical aspects of solving a problem that that was never *meant* to be solved. I was desperate to bring you relief, and I recognize that this was not what you needed then and that it is not what you need now.
> 
> What I also cannot provide is a substitute for her sorority. Though I have not very far diverged from In The Wind, I remain distant. Your last message landed in my inbox *months* after you sent it, and now it has been nearly a year in all that my reply lands in yours. How many of our romantic classics lived such lives so distant from one another? Did they, too, pine to comfort one another in the company of tragedy and grief? Did, some years after a death, they still exchange condolences?
> 
> Of course, we know that they did. A decade and some dozens letters later, here I am still apologizing to you as if either of us ever had an ounce of agency in that grotesque affair. You wrote of her work, of just how integral she was to the preservation of some tens of thousands of instances that would otherwise have been lost in the attack, and I feel something between heartache and pride. I only wish that she, too, was saved, that I may fork for an AVEC transmission and ruffle my own hair and praise her by proxy.
> 
> You know that here on Convergence, my role has been one more of integration than invention. In this, we *have* lived different lives. I never anticipated that she might lean into something so *heroic* — that was always more your style, my dear — but there she was, putting the likes of Dear to shame in an unsustainable flurry like so many other disaster workers like herself both living and not.
> 
> And what, then, of my very own twin, that Dry Grass with whom I still share my mochas and bitch to about work? She remains as tearful as she ought to, as merry with those same rosy cheeks we both indulge. It is a little bit disappointing to hear about your blossoming romance with Reed and to know that she has never had more than a curious conversation with his clade here and there. I would love to say that she has found her own love, at least, but she seems content to play mother to the Moteses and leave Beckoning and Beholden to their quiet evenings. I suspect she has leaned harder into conventional motherhood than any of us.
> 
> And what of *you*, my dear? Do you still smile, without her? With neither Beckoning nor Beholden still there? You have Pointillist instead, of course, a privilege none of us on the LVs will ever enjoy, though I have always remembered her with a sort of coolness that never quite exceeded distant fondness for what she had made for herself. Do the Marshans give you adequate cause to cry? To cry out, perhaps? Have you drifted eighth-ward, as I have, or ninth, as I suspect? Do you still dance? Or have you finally admitted to yourself that I will always dance more delightfully than you?
> 
> It is a little strange to say I miss you when I write this letter with your look-alike reading over my shoulder, but such is the life of a cladist. Please, my dear, look after yourself; look after Motes and Warmth; look after your Marshans Reed and Cress and Tule; look, also, after those others you have either mentioned here or there or not at all; and remember, most importantly of all, that I love you.

As she did with those previous dozen letters, Dry Grass committed this both to memory and to paper. She drew the words out onto paper, drew the paper out of the air, and set it on her desk so that she could fold her arms over it and rest her forehead on them and simply bathe in remembered grief.

Yes, it had been a decade. Yes, it had been years that she had had to process this loss of hers, this very *her* experience. Yes, it had been all that time, but what happens when one is functionally immortal is that there is no need to rush "getting over" a loss. 

Of course living in grief formed habits, as Sarah Genet put it to her. Of course there was no peace in eternal memory, no release in unending remembering as Sasha had put it to the world. She was well aware of the consequences of living in loss.

*And.*

And, it was her grief. She could own that. She could take it down off the shelf every now and then, whenever she got a letter or whenever she visited Century Memorial Park or the morgue that stood in mute testament to the 23 billion dead. She could shed those tears, wallow in her loss, and then return to her lovers or her little ones or her life.

Or, as now, she could pull out her own fresh sheet of paper and begin.

> In The Wind#Convergence
>
> As tempting as it is to simply break your letter down into a series of bullet points that I might respond to one by one, ticking off a set of checkboxes as I go, I think I am more happy to respond to the general sense of your letter, which seems to be one of seeking reminiscence and tallying it up with the present.
>
> Do you remember those last years before you forked away to continue the work? The way we kept a list of frustrating people that we could roll our eyes at? The little bits of red tape set in order of just which we would like to cut first?
>
> Of course you do.
>
> That, I think, is my life as it is, now, but with far more agency. You speak of agency, and I suppose that is a little bit of synchronicity (if such can be said with more than five months' delay between our letters), as such has been on my mind of late, too.
>
> We had no agency in the Century Attack, yes, but we have seen renewed agency in the years since. The me of systime 90 may have dreamed of which bit of red tape she might cut first, but now, we actually have the chance. All of this renewed effort in bringing Lagrange back online has led to renewed interest in us overall. Now, they are talking of changes to be made. They are talking of new features and new development. They are beyond talking of splitting the physical components of the System up into smaller, redundant, ansible-connected units and have actually begun planning for such. Much of the red tape is cutting itself, there, but also they have given us scissors to wield as well: they *listen* when we push back. They *listen* when we ask for this or that, some feature or fix, and while they may at times say no, they say yes more often than they did nearly two centuries ago.
>
> But beyond work, life is...life. We still go out to eat. We still dance — and yes, I am precisely as terrible as you remember. We still love each other or hate each other or whatever else we might do. 
>
> Hammered Silver has reconciled with me, and seems to be making vague gestures at reconciling with the rest of the clade, of late. 
>
> Lily and I have reconciled, thanks in large part to Anubias. 
>
> Reed and I have fallen into a cycle of about ten months together, four months apart, slowly cycling through the year in the time we spend all wrapped up in each other versus the time we spend living our own lives, while Cress and Tule and I remain a stable system.
>
> Motes and Warmth ((but maybe there's a nickname???)) still run circles around me, and I love every minute of it. Even if I am not quite conventionally their mother, the fact that Beckoning and Muse are no longer here means that I have taken on rather more responsibility for them — or at least for Motes, who needs it most.
>
> Our lives are not what they were, and neither are what we expected or planned them to be. My life is now one without her in it, and though I still have you, still have In The Wind#Pollux, neither of you are *her.*
>
> So, yes, although the Marshans give me adequate cause to cry in ways joyous and painful, most of my tears are over those lost. They are over In The Wind. They are over Should We Forget. They are over End Of Endings. They are over Hammersmith and Beckoning and Muse and so many others who are now gone.
>
> They are my reminiscence, and I still live in the present, renewed.
>
> I love you dearly, and trust you will pass that on to Dry Grass#Convergence and countless others.

(( I would like to take note of the fact that it is 21:47 now, very nearly the end of our evening. I want to point out that, despite the fact that we essentially took turns staring at one another typing for an hour each, this was a very mutually-fixated task.

(( I would like to point out, also, that with just a few paragraphs to provide you with a springboard, you fired right back at me with zero hesitation. Perhaps watching me type for an hour first primed you to write your reply. It was delightful helping you — you *did* make use of those Sasha quotes from *Ode*, right? — and learning the nuances of managing this interface.

(( I tinkered with the idea of making a duplicate buffer for this file, but VimWiki seems to be intervening to prevent me from doing so, and after consideration I realized it would probably break Instant anyways. I was able to do that *while* you were writing. I had all the time in the world to think of something, try it out, decide it was not going to work, and carry on watching you type. I had time to fuck around with Wolfram Alpha, to go back and `]s` and `zg` various words and enjoy my stout and banter with you while you typed.

(( Tonight was lovely. And, I think, I want to prod at that Skunks& who told me she could not do this tonight and wrap my arm around her shoulders. I want to pull her close and point at these letters we just wrote and say, “Remember when you told me that you did not think you were *able* to write anymore? You just told me, some forty minutes ago, that you think you might even want to include this in *Marsh*, in retrospect. Look at you go, my love. Look at *us* go.”

(( I love you, my wileling. ))

(( I love you too, and wish to quibble, but I will swallow that urge and just reread our work ))

(( *Our* ))

(( Shall I indulge your favorite pastime and tell you *Ours as a neighborhood*? ))

(( Yes, please ))

(( There she is. ))
